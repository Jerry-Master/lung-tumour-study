# lung-tumour-study
Github repository for my Bachelor's thesis. It is dedicated to study lung tumour through WSI.

## Dataset (in creation)

The dataset consists of a set of crowdsourced labelled WSI tiles of lung cancer. The labels correspond to the segmentation of cells and several classifications for each cell made by different annotators.

## Baseline (to do)

The initial baseline is set by Feliu's model and Hovernet's model trained with the majority voting annotations.

## Improvements (to do)

The baseline is expected to be improved by changing MV with crowdsourcing models like CrowdLayer or GP based crowdsourcing, as well as by changing the backbone to include graph neural networks.
