This project is created with the idea of helping researchers accelerate their work. 
It was born from a need to automate many repetitive tasks that were being done every day like converting from 
one data format to another, or performing hyperparameter tuning of a model. This library is supposed 
to simplify that process into three commands which are explained in :doc:`usage`.
It implements a method which uses convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks.
You can also visualise the process as shown above. More on that on the :ref:`visualisation section<viz>`.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
